# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
The Tic Tac Toe game I created is a classic two-player game designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

**Description:**
The game features a 3x3 grid, and players take turns placing their symbols—either an "X" or an "O." The objective is to align three of their symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 

**HTML** provides the structure for the grid and buttons, while 
**CSS** styles the layout, enhancing the visual appeal with colors and hover effects. 
The core functionality is powered by **JavaScript**, which manages game logic and player turns and checks for winning conditions or draws. The game also includes a restart button, allowing players to start a new match easily. Overall, it’s a fun and interactive way to enjoy this timeless game in a web browser!
